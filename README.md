# Expuesto

Expuesto is a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) of the [Revelar](https://wordpress.org/themes/revelar/) theme by Automattic. Before installing this theme, you must first install Revelar.

**So, what's the difference?**

Currently, not too much. I added some style adjustments to the header navigation to use Flexbox because I liked the way it looked. Additionally, I set adjusted how a password protected post is output to an end user.

In Revelar, only the post content was hidden for a password-protected post. In Expuesto, the post meta and the featured images are also hidden under the password protection.

Other than that, not really much of a difference. I really like Revelar but I wanted to be able to make some tweaks here and there to fit my own personal preferences. And while I'm at it, I may as well share my changes with the world too! :)
